# K9-Script
Need:
context script
keymapping script
target script

 
 
 Make your own item in the shared list
 
inventory: function.lua
  if (itemid == "k9")  then
        TriggerEvent("K9:Create")
    end 
    
 or you could do 
    if (itemid == "k9")  then
        TriggerEvent("K9:Funny")
    end 


the keyymapping and other things that you have to do is because I dont know/have access to your scripts, sorry
