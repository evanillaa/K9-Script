 k9 dependencys:

 context script
 keymapping script
 target script

 
 
 Make your own item in the shared list
 
--inventory: function.lua
  if (itemid == "k9")  then
        TriggerEvent("K9:Create")
    end


the keyymapping and other things that you have to do is because I dont know/have access to your scripts, sorry
